# Blog with 'AnalogJS'

One of the challenges when I go to register my learning on my blog is to find a platform that is easy for the server side rendering.

This project was make with the objective of experiment  with the platform "AnalogJS" a meta framework that uses "Angular" to build blogs for a way more simple.

## My challenges during this project
- The sintaxis is similar to Angular but not same
- The structure of the different folders is relevant, because that is   what your app browse depend on
- Rendering during coding was difficult because the local server was not showing me the result of the changes
