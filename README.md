# Blog with 'AnalogJS'

One of the challenges when I go to register my learnings on my blog is to find a platform that makes server side rendering easy.

This project was made with the objective of experimenting  with the platform "AnalogJS", a meta framework that uses "Angular" to build blogs in a simpler way.

## My challenges during this project

- The syntax is similar to Angular but not the same
- The structure of the different folders is relevant, because that is what your app's routes depend on
- Rendering during coding was difficult because the local server was not showing me the result of the changes
